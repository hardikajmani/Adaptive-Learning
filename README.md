# Adaptive-Learning
This is a c++ code that is a basic prototype for adaptive learning

Idea : To make an evaluating system that adpats according to the user

Description : Evaluation is an important part of the learning experience and making it more efficient and dynamic will directly effect the learning experience.The system will dynamically change its toughness according to the user and hence the ongoing performance of the user.
If user answers correctly increase the level otherwise decrease it.

So this project is just a simplified application of the above idea.


Code: So what does the code do.
  1) It is a jumbled word game
  2) Each user starts with 3 letter words.
  3) It will increase the level( take it to 4 letter words) if answered 2 correct answers in a row.
  4) It will decrease the level on each incorrect answer.
  5) A final step with score and further action is printed.
  
Scope:  1) Combined with the power of Machine Learning and Big Data this can be applied to various evaluation system.
        2) Further research can be done on making it more effecient and practically applicable.
